## Featured Projects
- [**AI-Powered Assembly Verification System (Hackathon Project | Real Time Problem Statement)**](https://github.com/dnyaneshsb20/Code_Pirates_Hackathon_PS-4) - We built a real-time assembly verification system using Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). Our solution detects missing or incorrect steps during product assembly and helps prevent rework, recalls, and safety issues. We created a working demo using the Airdopes assembly process, where the system identified mistakes instantly. The project was built using Python, Streamlit for the dashboard, OpenCV for video processing, YOLOv8 for object detection, and VLLM for reasoning. The system generates JSON outputs and annotated frames that can be viewed on a live Streamlit dashboard. This project taught me how to combine AI vision models with real-time monitoring to solve real industry problems.
- [**Heritage Bites (Research Project)**](https://github.com/dnyaneshsb20/ResearchProjectHeritageBites) – I built a full-stack recipe and e-marketplace platform using React, Supabase, FastAPI, and Tailwind CSS. Heritage Bites allows users to explore traditional recipes, buy farm-fresh ingredients, leave reviews, and interact with an AI-powered chatbot. It includes features like recipe management, user dashboards, farmer product listings, an order system, sentiment analysis for feedback, and a secure authentication flow. While building it, I learned how to integrate Supabase for real-time data, implement multi-role systems (users, farmers, admin), and connect ML models with FastAPI for smart feedback insights.
- [**MediCloud**](https://github.com/dnyaneshsb20/medicloud) - I created a full-stack healthcare management system using React, TypeScript, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS. MediCloud helps doctors, patients, and pharmacists manage appointments, prescriptions, and medical records in real time. It includes doctor dashboards, patient dashboards, prescription handling, and a pharmacist module. I learned how to build real-time data features using Supabase and manage multiple user roles in one system.
- [**Milk Products Management System**](https://github.com/dnyaneshsb20/Milk-Products-Management-System) – I have created a CSharp and MySQL-based Milk Products Management System to help Dairy Shop Owners. It will
easily calculate bills, maintain records, reduce manual work, and save time.
- [**User Authentication System**](https://github.com/dnyaneshsb20/User-Authentication-System) – I have created a Java and Oracle-based User Authentication System to help websites and applications manage user login and registration. Securely verifies user details, stores log-in data, and prevents unauthorized access, making the system safer and more reliable. I learned on my own how to use Java to safely store passwords by converting them into a secure
format.
- [**Scan and See – AR for Instant Data Access**](https://github.com/dnyaneshsb20/Scan-and-See---Augumented-Reality-Instant-Data-Access) – I created an AR project called ’Scan and See’ using the AR Studio website and a separate Android app. It scans QR codes, checks the link with Supabase, and shows card details if the link is valid. I learned on my own how to connect the app to Supabase and match the QR codes scanned with the stored data.

- [**Data Packet Flow in Network Layer**](https://github.com/dnyaneshsb20/Data-Packet-Flow-in-Network-Layer) – Created a web-based interactive simulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visually represent how data packets travel through the network layer. The tool demonstrates IP packet flow, routing decisions, and path traversal across routers, enhancing conceptual clarity of OSI Layer 3. Designed with a user-friendly interface to support educational use.

## Mini Projects
- [**MediCloud-Medical-Bill-Analyzer**](https://github.com/dnyaneshsb20/MediCloud-Medical-Bill-Analyzer) - Developed an interactive Streamlit-based data analytics dashboard to visualize and analyze healthcare billing data. Used Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Faker to generate synthetic datasets, display key metrics (revenue, doctor performance, symptoms), and create bar/pie charts for insights. Enabled dynamic filtering and CSV export for data-driven analysis.
- **Clap Switch** – Smart Home IoT project that controls a device using sound. When you clap, Arduino detects it and switches the LED on or off.
- [**To-Do List**](https://github.com/dnyaneshsb20/To-Do-List-DSA) – DSA-based C++ project that manages tasks using a linked list. Users can add, delete, and view tasks sorted by deadlines.
- [**Turtle Crossing: Beat the Traffic**](https://github.com/dnyaneshsb20/Turtle-Crossing--Game) – Python game where you control a turtle trying to cross a busy road while avoiding cars that move faster as levels increase.
- [**Snake Game**](https://github.com/dnyaneshsb20/Snake-Game) – Python game made with Turtle graphics where a snake eats food, grows, and avoids hitting walls or itself. Tracks score and allows restart.
- [**Quiz App**](https://github.com/dnyaneshsb20/Quiz-App) – Python + Tkinter desktop app that asks multiple-choice questions, shows score, and runs smoothly on any computer.
- [**Work Sessions**](https://github.com/dnyaneshsb20/Work-Sessions) – Desktop tool that tracks work sessions with start/end times, helping monitor productivity.
- [**Password Manager**](https://github.com/dnyaneshsb20/Password-Manager-Project) – Python desktop app that stores and manages passwords, generates random passwords, and saves login details using Tkinter interface.
- [**Paddle Battle – 2 Player Ball Game**](https://github.com/dnyaneshsb20/PONG-Game) – Python Turtle graphics game where two players control paddles to hit a ball; first to 5 points wins.
